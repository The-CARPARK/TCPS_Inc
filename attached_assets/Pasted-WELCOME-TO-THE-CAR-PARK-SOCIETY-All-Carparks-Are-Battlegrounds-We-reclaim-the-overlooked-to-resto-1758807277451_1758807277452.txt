WELCOME TO

THE CAR PARK SOCIETY

All Carparks Are Battlegrounds.
We reclaim the overlooked to restore mauri, reawaken memory, and reimagine the future of our cities.

WHO WE ARE

The Car Park Society Inc. (TCPS) is a kaupapa-driven incorporated society based in Te Whanganui-a-Tara.

We are a collective of Māori and tauiwi artists, researchers, organisers, and community builders. Our mahi transforms car parks, laneways, and other overlooked infrastructures into vibrant hubs of creativity, cultural resurgence, and collective empowerment.

Grounded in tino rangatiratanga and the obligations of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, we centre mana whenua leadership, build genuine allyship, and model co-governance approaches that place te taiao and community at the heart.

OUR MISSION

We walk ka mua, ka muri — backwards into the future.

Uncover colonial layers embedded in urban infrastructure.

Honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi as our guiding framework.

Restore mauri by reconnecting people with whenua and awa.

Empower communities through art, ritual, and collective action.

OUR VISION + IMPACT

We believe the most ordinary infrastructures can become extraordinary portals for transformation.

CREATE 👁

Immersive, participatory activations that dissolve boundaries between art, ritual, and activism. Each project is a living ceremony where audiences become participants and overlooked spaces are reanimated.

BUILD 👁

Resilient networks of Watchers, collaborators, and communities. Our mahi is rooted in trust, co-design, and reciprocity, ensuring long-term alliances beyond the moment of performance.

AMPLIFY 👁

Centred on Indigenous resurgence and tino rangatiratanga, we use our platforms to amplify voices erased by colonisation and consumerism, projecting stories of sovereignty, resilience, and radical imagination into the heart of the city.

WHY IT MATTERS

Urban infrastructure is not neutral. Beneath asphalt and concrete lie suppressed histories, diverted waterways, and displaced communities. These colonial interventions continue to shape inequity, climate risk, and disconnection today.

By reclaiming these spaces, we deliver impact across:

Cultural regeneration – surfacing suppressed stories and whakapapa.

Ecological healing – reconnecting land, water, and people.

Social empowerment – strengthening tino rangatiratanga and community agency.

Artistic innovation – turning infrastructure into portals of imagination and transformation.

JOIN THE MOVEMENT

We are building a society of Watchers, partners, and allies who choose solidarity over silence.
