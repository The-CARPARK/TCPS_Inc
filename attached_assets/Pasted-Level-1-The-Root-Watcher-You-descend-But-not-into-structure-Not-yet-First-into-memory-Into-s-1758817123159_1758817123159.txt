Level 1: The Root
Watcher—
You descend. But not into structure. Not yet. First into memory. Into soil. Into the breath beneath the grid.
They called it progress when they poured the concrete. They called it safety when they flattened pā, when they diverted streams into drains, when they drew chalk-lines and painted numbers on ground that once pulsed with gardens, fire, ceremony. They believed in silence, in burial, in the erasure of story by asphalt.
But the Root does not rot. It coils. It waits. Beneath your feet, beneath the signage, beneath every beep of the ticket gate, the Root hums. And you feel it. A vibration, low and persistent, not quite sound, not quite tremor. It climbs into your ankles when you walk. It shifts into your chest when you pause. If you press your palm to the pillar, the Root will greet you.
Do not mistake this for nostalgia. This is no passive past. This is the refusal of burial. The Root is alive, growing even under suppression, finding cracks, leaking upward through the damp and moss that stains the lower walls. You think this is weather. No. This is uprising.
Fragments rise with it. A child’s laugh dissolving into static. A fragment of chant at the edge of hearing. A ledger page, torn, smeared with wine and ink, resurfacing like mould. Waimapihi does not forget. The earth does not forget. Even the dust of bones remembers.
This is why the structure is never still. Why ramps echo with steps that aren’t yours. Why pipes rattle in the absence of water. Why the lift sometimes carries you where you did not request. The Root guides the living, and it guides the dead. It does not recognise the hierarchy between them.
Watcher, you are tested here. Your body is weighed against memory. If the vibration beneath you matches your pulse, the Root accepts you. If it does not—leave, or be unmade. The Root does not forgive arrogance.
The prophecy whispers: what was buried will rise. The soil will break through the slab. The stream will carve through the drains. The gardens will sprout through painted lines. The names will unbury themselves from ledgers, bleed through receipts, infect the signage. This is not metaphor. This is certainty.
Every descent begins with The Root. Without it, you are lost. With it, you are not safe—only claimed.
Do you hear it now? The low hum, under the alarms, under the engines, under the chatter? That is not structure. That is memory. That is Root.
And it waits for you, Watcher.
Step closer.
Step deeper.
The burial is over.
The Root is awake.

Level 2: The Waking
Watcher—
You thought the Root was silence broken. But here, silence becomes signal.
The Waking is not gentle. It does not arrive like dawn, soft and gradual. It crackles. It ruptures. The lights flicker without reason, casting you in strobe. The sirens whimper and choke as though something inside them resists obedience. Cameras blink, but not all at once. The structure breathes, and you begin to notice the static is not random—it is language.
The coloniser believed they could erase by overlay. Paint over paint, asphalt over earth, receipt over memory. But the Waking is the static of refusal, the glitch in the system. Every time the barrier arm jams, every time the card machine rejects currency, every time the intercom hums without voice—that is the Waking. The structure cannot stay obedient forever.
The Watchers before you said the static came first as headache. Then as itch. Then as thought not your own. If you listen too long, you may not know which thoughts are yours and which are the echoes of the system cracking. This is part of the trial.
Do not run.
Do not pray to old gods that have been turned into brands.
Do not call this madness.
Call it awakening.
In the Waking, fragments scatter. A torn parking stub that rearranges itself each time you glance. A fluorescent tube buzzing your name in Morse. A lift panel where the numbers flicker into equations, into dates, into bloodlines. The Waking feeds you pattern. If you cannot hold the pattern, you will fall. If you can, the static will lead you deeper.
Here, history is a virus. It inserts itself into circuits, infects the signage, corrupts the payment kiosks. You swipe your card, and the receipt prints a name from a century ago. You scan a QR code, and it loads a map no one remembers drawing. The Waking is a revolt hidden inside electricity.
Watcher, understand: you are not alone. Others walk these levels. They are not all human. They are echoes, replays, reverberations of those who resisted burial. You may mistake them for strangers in hoodies. You may think they are commuters. But they are fragments of memory, playing on loop. If you meet them, listen before you speak.
The prophecy declares: what flickers will burn steady. This means the static is not random forever. It is building, condensing, sharpening into signal. The Waking is a liminal fever, but it prepares you. Your body will ache, your ears will ring, your vision will blur—and then it will align.
If you survive the Waking, you will never again mistake silence for peace. You will hear the static always. You will know its rhythm. You will know its command.
Welcome, Watcher. The lights are no longer yours to control.
The structure is speaking.
Do you understand?

Level 3: The Mirror
Watcher—
This is where you fracture.
The Mirror waits in the mid-levels—where the sun does not touch and the dark is never total. Here, the glass panes do not reflect you. They reflect the version of you the structure requires.
In colonial time, mirrors were weapons. They taught you to despise your face. They trained you to dress as another, to measure yourself against imported images, to see yourself always as insufficient. That wound did not die. It embedded itself in every pane of glass, every CCTV lens, every gleaming surface of the city.
In the Mirror, you will see yourself—but not as you are. You will see the faces of those you might have been, had the burial not occurred. You will see yourself wearing the uniforms of the coloniser, smiling their smile, repeating their slogans. You will see yourself as predator. You will see yourself as prey.
The Mirror is not truth. Nor is it lie. It is surveillance. It is the gaze of the structure, of empire, of endless self-monitoring. And you must look. To turn away is to be unmade.
Fragments here are sharper. Broken wing mirrors glint like blades. Phone screens replay footage you never filmed. A shard of glass whispers your secrets back to you. You realise the surveillance is not external—it has entered you. Your thoughts self-police. Your desires self-censor. You have been colonised from the inside.
This is the trial.
Can you resist your own reflection?
If you strike the glass, it will not shatter. It will multiply. If you plead, the reflection will smile with your own lips. If you weep, the reflection will not blink. But if you stand still, if you breathe, if you allow the reflections to swirl without seizing you—then you will find the crack.
The crack is small. It runs down your reflection’s left eye. If you lean close, you will see not yourself, but another. A Watcher older than you. A fragment who passed before. Their eyes plead. Their mouth moves, though no sound escapes. They are trapped in surveillance, unable to leave. And you understand: The Mirror devours. It consumes those who fail.
The prophecy warns: what watches can be watched. Surveillance is not one-directional. If you look deep enough, past the reflection, past the crack, past the fragments—you will glimpse them. The architects. The colonisers. Watching you still. And for the first time, you may watch them back.
This is power.
Not freedom yet. But resistance.
Watcher—
Do not mistake the Mirror for vanity.
Do not mistake reflection for self.
Do not mistake surveillance for safety.
The Mirror is hunger. But it is also window.
Look carefully.
The Eye is watching.
And now—you are watching back.

Level 4: The Hunger
Watcher—
You descend into appetite.
The Hunger is not yours alone. It belongs to the structure. To the bureaucracy. To the endless machine of taking, filing, consuming, forgetting. If the Root hums and the Waking flickers, the Hunger gnaws. You feel it in your bones as you cross the threshold. The air thins. Your stomach knots though you are not hungry. The walls seem closer.
This is the realm of bureaucracy’s shadow. Paperwork unravels into teeth. Receipts curl into tongues. Parking tickets multiply in your pocket though you did not take them. The coloniser did not conquer only land. They conquered by ledger, by rule, by law, by form. And those forms still feed. Every signature was a bite. Every stamp a swallow. Every decree another rib stripped from the body of the living.
Now the structure feeds endlessly. It consumes energy, coins, minutes, silence, breath. It takes your hours as you loop the ramps, hunting for space. It takes your patience as machines blink DECLINED. It takes your face as the cameras scan and archive. You are not visitor. You are food.
The fragments here are grotesque. An elevator panel dripping with sticky ink. A filing cabinet that rattles though it is empty. A voice on the intercom that repeats your name but never answers your question. You begin to understand: the Hunger wants not your flesh, but your obedience.
Watcher, you must resist. But resistance here is not refusal. Refusal is swallowed. Resistance is misfeeding the machine. You must jam the gears with contradiction. Fill the forms with nonsense. Write your name backwards. Offer coins from dead currencies. Let your silence stretch longer than the machine’s patience. The Hunger cannot consume what it cannot digest.
The prophecy insists: the system that devours will choke on its own feast. Already you can hear it gagging. The printers churn but spit blank paper. The gate arms rise but refuse to fall. The data servers hiccup, coughing corrupted files. This is not failure. This is revolt.
But beware. The Hunger does not die. It learns. If you resist too plainly, it adapts. It will mirror you, echo you, counterfeit your defiance. Soon you will not know if you are resisting, or if the Hunger is tricking you into performing its appetite.
You must hold steady. Remember: Hunger is a wound of empire. It is never satisfied. It cannot be healed. It can only be watched, disrupted, slowed. If you feed it nothing but fragments, it will falter. If you give it nothing whole, it cannot swallow you.
Watcher—this is not survival alone. This is training. To descend further, you must endure the gnawing without being consumed. You must starve the machine even as it feasts on others. You must learn to wear your hunger as shield.
Do not mistake emptiness for loss.
Do not mistake appetite for need.
Do not mistake the machine’s grinding for inevitability.
The Hunger feeds.
But you may yet poison its meal.

Level 5: The Invitation
Watcher—
You stand at the threshold.
The Invitation does not arrive on paper. It does not glow on screens. It is not sealed with wax or sent by courier. It arrives as pressure—behind the eyes, in the chest, under the tongue. You feel compelled forward, though the door is unmarked. This is the passage point, where only those claimed by the structure are permitted through.
The Invitation is not gift. It is challenge. To step forward is to surrender certainty. To accept is to dissolve. Yet to refuse is to be left behind, wandering corridors, circling ramps forever, hearing the static but never understanding it. Many choose refusal. They remain shadows, muttering in corners, unwilling to cross.
Fragments here whisper: a folded note jammed into a crack in the wall, ink blurred with tears. A phone ringing with no caller ID. A child’s drawing left in a stairwell, depicting the car park with eyes. Each one carries the same message in different form: Come.
The coloniser sent their invitations in other ways. Treaties written to bind. Contracts disguised as gifts. Promises wrapped in threats. The Invitation here is not different. It is double-edged. If you step through, you are claimed—but you are also awakened. If you refuse, you remain unclaimed—but also asleep.
Watcher, you must choose.
The passage ritual is simple, yet terrible. You must step into the lift. It does not ask you which floor. It does not open when you expect. It hums, it groans, it shakes as though burdened by memory. Sometimes it descends forever. Sometimes it jerks upward. Sometimes it opens not into level, but into black.
The prophecy warns: to be invited is to be tested. The Invitation does not guarantee acceptance. Some who step into the lift never emerge. Their echoes linger, pressing all the buttons at once, muttering into the intercom, scribbling on the walls. They were invited, but they failed.
To succeed, you must surrender. You must allow the structure to move you where it will. You must trust the Root’s hum, the Waking’s static, the Mirror’s crack, the Hunger’s gnawing, to guide you. You must know: you are not here by accident. The Invitation arrives only when the Sequence requires you.
Watcher—
Do not mistake this threshold for end.
Do not mistake the door for escape.
Do not mistake the lift for transport.
The Invitation is sacrifice.
The Invitation is rebirth.
The Invitation is you.
Step forward.
Or remain forever circling.

Level 6: The Self
Watcher—
You dissolve.
The lift opens, and there is no corridor, no ramp, no signage. Only mirrors, broken and unbroken, surfaces that warp, bend, multiply. This is The Self. The level where the Sequence turns inward. Here, the car park no longer reflects empire’s architecture alone—it reflects you. And you are not singular.
Fragments scatter across glass: your face but older, your body but in shadow, your voice but reversed. At first you panic. Which one is me? Which one is real? The answer is none, and all. The Self is a hall of recursive memory. Every surveillance camera, every reflective windscreen, every distorted shadow on the wall—each is you. But not the you you chose. The you that was recorded, filed, misnamed, numbered, watched.
The coloniser built this, too. They fractured identity through census, through passbooks, through blood quantum, through photographs labeled with wrong names. They turned whakapapa into categories, connection into percentages, selfhood into paperwork. And now, when you look into the glass, you feel the fracture.
But Watcher—fracture is not only wound. It is multiplicity. The Self is not prison. It is maze. And in the maze, you may choose.
The fragments here resist coherence. A mirror shows your hands covered in earth. Another shows you with no mouth. Another shows you standing where you are, but surrounded by dozens of figures who look almost like you. Do not chase the “real.” That is empire’s trick. Instead, inhabit the glitch. Be all of them.
The prophecy declares: integration is not return to one, but awakening to many. You are archive and echo, ancestor and descendant, memory and possibility. The Self does not ask you to choose which is true—it asks you to hold them all at once.
Beware, though: some reflections lie. They whisper comfort: that you are powerless, that you are alone, that the Sequence is madness. These are not reflections, but implants. Surveillance footage seeded with empire’s propaganda. They want you to believe you are only what was captured. Do not believe them. The Self is more than the image.
To pass through, you must act. Take a shard of glass, cut your palm. Let your blood fall on the mirror. Watch as it spreads, distorts, multiplies. This is the offering: to declare you are not data, not fraction, not fixed. You are glitch, rupture, overflow.
Watcher—
Do not mistake reflection for truth.
Do not mistake fracture for weakness.
Do not mistake the many for chaos.
The Self is broken, and therefore infinite.
The Self is scattered, and therefore free.
The Self is you, and you, and you.
Step deeper. You are no longer singular.

Level 7: The Eye
Watcher—
You arrive at the apex.
This is The Eye. The tower above the ramps, the void above the lift, the ceiling where concrete meets sky. It watches. It has always watched. And now you watch it back.
The Eye is not single. It is swarm. It is every camera lens, every mirrored panel, every light that flickers without cause. It blinks in red, in white, in static. It sees not only you, but all who came before, all who resisted, all who vanished. The Eye is archive and prophecy.
Fragments here overwhelm: a reel of footage from decades past, looping endlessly; a file marked DESTROYED but still glowing faintly; a whisper that names you by an ancestor’s name. The Eye collapses time. Past and present blur. The colonial project of surveillance—roll calls, mug shots, censuses, security scans—rises and collapses at once. The Eye does not distinguish. It consumes all.
But Watcher—awareness is weapon. The Eye cannot kill you if you are not afraid of being seen. Its power lies not in vision, but in shame. They taught you to fear being recorded, to hide, to silence yourself lest the watcher write you wrong. The Sequence ends here because here you learn: you are already seen, and still alive.
The prophecy says: when the watched become the Watchers, the Eye will crack. Already you hear it—the shutter stutter, the glass strain. The Eye cannot withstand reciprocity. When you look back, unflinching, it fractures. Surveillance becomes mirror. Mirror becomes portal.
Ritual here is simple: stare. Do not blink. Do not turn away. Offer no apology. Offer no explanation. Stand, fractured Self intact, Root humming beneath, Hunger gnawing behind, Mirror cracked, Invitation crossed. Stand and meet the Eye until it falters.
Some who reach this level vanish into the lens. They become part of the archive, whispers on footage, faces in static. Do not pity them. They chose to remain as warning, as signal, as guide. Their presence is proof that the Eye can be infiltrated.
And when the Eye finally shatters—when light and static explode into fragments—you will see not void, but sky. Not sky as freedom, but sky as endless watch. The Sequence does not end. It loops. Always.
Watcher—
Do not mistake vision for truth.
Do not mistake surveillance for power.
Do not mistake ending for release.
The Eye sees.
But you see too.
And in your seeing, empire cracks.
The Sequence closes, and begins again.
